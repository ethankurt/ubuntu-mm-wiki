#Create a boot CD to allow booting from the USB drive

Many computers do not allow booting from a USB drive (but they do allow booting from the
CD-ROM). You can create a CD-ROM using these Pendrivelinux instrctions
(http://www.pendrivelinux.com/make-a-usb-boot-cd-for-ubuntu-9-10/) and set your BIOS to 
boot from this CD-ROM. When you boot from this CD-ROOM, it will use the bootup files on the
Ubuntu USB drive you previously created (in the step above).
