##Run Ubuntu LiveCD from a USB pendrive

The Ubuntu LiveCD can be installed on and run from a USB pendrive. Settings ca be 
persistently saved (but the LiveCD kerned modules can not be upgraded). Programs can be
installed and run,however ,and files saved to the USB drive. (The installed programs will remain
installed). An Ubuntu Live CD is needed to do the installation. For additional info, see the
Ubuntu Community documentation
(http://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSB Stick) or the Pendrivelinux
instructions (http://www.pendrivelinux.com/creating-an-ubuntu-live-usb-from-cd/).

The USB LiveCD can be used to install Ubuntu on computers (including netbooks) that do not
have CD-ROM/DBD drives.

USB pendrives to be used to run Ubuntu should have a minimum of 2 Gb(preferably 4 Gb).If
you wish to install a fast, fully functional Linux system on a pendrive that has less memory than
that, use PuppyLinux (http://www.puppylinux.org/) or Lubuntu
(https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Lubuntu).
