##dd

[dd](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dd_%28Unix%29) is a unix command that enables the copying of files or an entire disk using a single command. Parameters must be precisely specified to avoid risk of accidentally erasing data. See these [brief instructions](http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/dd-invocation.html) or [these instructions](http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/dd.html) for detailed options. You cannot copy a hard drive that contains the operating system you are currently running. Instead, boot into a LiveCD and run the dd command that way. An example command to copy Hard drive X to Hard drive Y is:

	dd if=/dev/hdx of=/dev/hdy

[ddrescue](http://www.garloff.de/kurt/linux/ddrescue/) is a variation of the dd command that allows working with potentially corrupted datasets, partitions, or hard drives.
