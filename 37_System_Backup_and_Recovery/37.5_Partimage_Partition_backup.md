##Partimage (Partition backup)

[Partimage](http://sourceforge.net/projects/partimage/) is a free open-source utility to back up an entire partition into an .iso image. It can be used across a network, as well. Install and run:

		sudo apt-get install partimage
		sudo partimage

Partimage cannot be used from within the partition you wish to backup. You will either have to run it from a different partition or from a [LiveCD that contains it](http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu:Trusty#System_Rescue_and_Cloning_Utilities). (A serious limitation of Partimage is its inability to backup/restore split image files to/from multiple media (e.g. spanned DVDs/CDs), limiting its usefulness as an inexpensive cloning and distribution solution. Partition image backup/restoration must be to/from a single hard drive, large capacity USB stick, or networked storage space.)
