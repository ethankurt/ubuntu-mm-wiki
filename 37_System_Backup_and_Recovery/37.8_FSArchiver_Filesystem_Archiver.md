##FSArchiver (Filesystem Archiver)

[FSArchiver](http://www.fsarchiver.org/) is a utility to backup the filesystem by files (instead of by partition blocks). A filesystem backed up in this way can be moved to a different sized partition or another disk filesystem altogether (e.g. from ext3 to ext4). Backups can be split and stored on (and restored from) spanned media (e.g. multiple DVDs/CDs). It is included in the [System Rescue CD](http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu:Trusty#System_Rescue_CD). 

Install:

	sudo apt-get install fsarchiver
