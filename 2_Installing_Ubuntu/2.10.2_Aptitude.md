###Aptitude

Aptitude is a terminal-based package manager that can be used instead of apt-get. Aptitude marks package that are automatically installed and removes them when no packages depend on them. This makes it easy to remove application completely. To use Aptitude, replace apt-get with aptitude in the command line.Example

	sudo aptitude install packagename
	sudo aptitude remove packagename 
	sudo aptitude update
	sudo aptitude upgrade

For an ncurses-based graphical user interface, type

	sudo aptitude
